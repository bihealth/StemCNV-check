If you encounter issues please:
 - make sure they are reproducible
 - indentify the step where the error occurs
 - rerun the workflow with an added "-vv" flag and record the output
   - i.e. ``stemcnv-check -vv > log.txt 2>&1``
 - Open a new issue on the `StemCNV-check GitHub repository <https://github.com/bihealth/StemCNV-check/>`_

 - You may need to create a GitHub account if you do not have one
 - make sure to attach the captured log output as well as the relevant log files produced by the snakemake rules (see 4.2)

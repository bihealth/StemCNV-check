First analysis
============
Before the first analysis sample table and config file need to be set up (see above). Unless otherwise specified, stemcnv-check defaults to look for a "sample_table.tsv" (or .xlsx) and "config.yaml" file.

It is recommended to start by **creating a separate folder** for your project. This folder should include raw data folder, config.yaml and sample table files.

Config file settings
============

Setting analysis parameters or changing them requires editing the text in the generated default config file. Start by opening the config.yaml in text editor. Then type in or change the necessary parameters. 

The default config file (config.yaml) defines all settings for the analysis and inherits from the inbuilt default.

Adjust the config file so that all entries marked as ``“#REQUIRED”`` are filled in.

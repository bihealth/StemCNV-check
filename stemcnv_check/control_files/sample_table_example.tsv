# All lines that start with a `#` will be ignored by the pipeline								
# Required Columns are: Sample_ID	Chip_Name	Chip_Pos	Array_Name	Sex	Reference_Sample			
# Any number of additional/optional columns can be used, but the columns `Regions_of_Interest` and `Sample_Name` have specific usage if included								
# Specific explanations for columns:								
# - Sample_ID:								
#       The folder and samples names for samples are derived from this entry. All entries *must* be unique and								
#       conform with unix filename patterns (i.e. no /). The recommended default allows only alphanumeric characters and -_								
# - Chip_Name and Chip_Pos:								
#       These entries must match the Sentrix name (usually a 12 digit number) and position (usually R..C..) on the Illumina array								
# - Array_Name								
#       The name of the array used for the sample. This needs to match one of the arrays defined in the config under `array_definition`								
# - Sex								
#       The sex of the sample is needed for analysis and mandatory. Allowed: f[emale]/m[ale] (not case sensitive)								
# - Reference_Sample								
#       This column should refer to the (exact) Sample_ID of reference sample (i.e. a parental fibroblast line or master bank)								
#       If there is no usable or applicable reference sample the entry should be empty								
# - Sample_Name								
#       This is used in the report instead of the Sample_ID. Can contain any kind of character								
# - Regions_of_Interest								
#       Definition of regions for which plots are always generated in the report (i.e. gene edited sites)								
#       The syntax for regions is `NAME|chr?:start-end`, the `NAME|` part is optional, `chr?` can be i.e. 'chr3' or just '3'								
#       multiple regions for a single sample should all be in one column entry and be separated by a `;`								
# Any other number of additional/optional columns can be added (here Sample_Group)								
#       These can be referred to in the config to determine i.e. which samples are included for dendrogram clustering of SNPS

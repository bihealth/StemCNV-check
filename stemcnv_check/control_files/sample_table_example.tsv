# All lines that start with a `#` will be ignored by the pipeline
# Required Columns are: Sample_ID, Chip_Name, Chip_Pos, Array_Name, Sex, Reference_Sample, Regions_of_Interest, Sample_Group
# Any number of additional columns can be added to the sample table as well, unless referred to in the config they will be ignored.
# Specific explanations for columns:
# - Sample_ID:		
#       The folder and samples names for samples are derived from this entry. All entries *must* be unique and
#       conform with unix filename patterns (i.e. no /). The recommended default allows only alphanumeric characters and -_
# - Chip_Name and Chip_Pos:
#       These entries must match the Sentrix name (usually a 12 digit number) and position (usually R..C..) on the Illumina array
# - Array_Name
#       The name of the array used for the sample. This needs to match one of the arrays defined in the config under `array_definition`
# - Sex
#       The sex of the sample is needed for analysis and mandatory. Allowed: f[emale]/m[ale] (not case sensitive)
# - Reference_Sample
#       This column should refer to the (exact) Sample_ID of reference sample (i.e. a parental fibroblast line or master bank)
#       If there is no usable or applicable reference sample the entry should be empty
# - Regions_of_Interest
#       Definition of regions for which plots are always generated in the report (i.e. gene edited sites)
#       The syntax for regions is `NAME|chr?:start-end`, the `NAME|` part is optional, `chr?` can be i.e. 'chr3' or just '3'
#       multiple regions for a single sample should all be in one column entry and be separated by a `;`	
# - Sample_Group
#       This column can be used for annotation samples is used by default to select samples for clustering by SNPs.

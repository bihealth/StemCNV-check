# All lines that start with a `#` will be ignored by the pipeline
# Required Columns are: Sample_Name	Chip_Name	Chip_Pos	Sample_ID	Sex	Reference_Sample
# Any number of additional/optional columns can be used, but the columns `Regions_of_Interest` and `Sample_Name` have specific usage if included
# Specific explanations for columns:
# - Sample_ID:
#       The folder and samples names for samples are derived from this entry. All entries *must* be unique and
#       conform with unix filename patterns (i.e. no /). The recommended default allows only alphanumeric characters and -_
# - Chip_Name and Chip_Pos:
#       These entries must match the Sentrix name (usually a 12 digit number) and position (usually R..C..) on the Illumina array
# - Sex
#       The sex of the sample is needed for analysis and mandatory. Allowed: f[emale]/m[ale] (not case sensitive)
# - Reference_Sample
#       This column should refer to the (exact) Sample_ID of reference sample (i.e. a parental fibroblast line or master bank)
#       If there is no usable or applicable reference sample the entry should be empty
# - Sample_Name
#       This is used in the report instead of the Sample_ID. Can contain any kind of character
# - Regions_of_Interest
#       Definition of regions for which plots are always generated in the report (i.e. gene edited sites)
#       The syntax for regions is `NAME|chr?:start-end`, the `NAME|` part is optional, `chr?` can be i.e. 'chr3' or just '3'
#       multiple regions for a single sample should all be in one column entry and be separated by a `;`
# Any other number of additional/optional columns can be added (here Sample_Group)
#       These can be referred to in the config to determine i.e. which samples are included for dendrogram clustering of SNPS

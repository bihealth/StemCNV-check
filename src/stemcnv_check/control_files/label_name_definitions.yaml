# Specification of labels (and their report colors) assigned to sample level QC measures
sample_labels:
    OK: green
    unusual: yellow
    warning: orange
    high concern: red

# Default labels for CNVs (more can be added by users)
#FIXME: add descriptions, maybe fully move this here from the config?
CNV_labels:
    # This is used to count critical CNVs & LOHs
    - Critical de-novo
    # This is used to count reportable CNVs & LOHs
    - Reportable de-novo
    - de-novo call
    - Reference genotype
    - Excluded call

# Label for CNVs merged from multiple callers
combined_cnvs: 'combined-call'

# Possible/Defined FILTERs applied to CNV calls (vcf style)
vcf_filters:
    min_size: "CNV call below min. size <{toolconfig$filter.minlength}bp"
    min_probes: "CNV call from <{toolconfig$filter.minprobes} probes"
    min_density: "CNV call with <{toolconfig$filter.mindensity} probes/Mb"
    high_probe_dens: "Probe density of segment is higher than {round(100*toolconfig$density.quantile.cutoff, 1)}% of the array"
    probe_gap: "Probe coverage of segment has considerable gap (min. {round(100*toolconfig$min.perc.gap_area, 1)}% depending on probe number - see config)"

# Possible/Defined categories for SNVs, each category can be assigned as critical or reportable
SNV_categories:
    ROI-overlap: "SNV overlapping a sample specific regions of interest"
    hotspot-match: "SNV matching a known stemcell hotspot mutation (see also SNV hotspot coverage)"
    hotspot-gene: "SNV in a gene with known iPSC hotspots (see also SNV hotspot coverage)"
    protein-ablation: "SNV (likely) fully disrupting protein function (i.e. frameshift, stop gain, stop loss)"
    protein-changing: "SNV causing a change the protein sequence (i.e. missense, inframe)"
    other: "SNV with other unclear or undetermined effect on protein function"

# possible labels for SNVs
SNV_labels:
    critical: "SNV with likely critical significance on hiPSC line"
    reportable: "SNV with possible significance on hiPSC line"
    unreliable impact: "SNV with likely or possible significance on hiPSC line, but unreliable signal"
    de-novo SNV: "SNV with de-novo status, but no clear functional impact"
    reference genotype: "SNV already detected in the reference sample"
